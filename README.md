1: date of transaction
2: text description of the transaction
3: the amount of transaction

Based on this provided data, please write a program which is able to take in a similar transaction log in the same format and output a list of recommendations, tips and strategy in order for the user to save money. 

# Input:

Your program will take in a .csv file which contains the transaction log of . You can choose to dump this .csv into a database or you can read it from disk. Your program must provide a way for us to insert a transaction log in the same format as the provided log. Whether this is a command line argument pointing to the file or a web interface to upload the file is up to you. 

# Output:

This is really up to you and we want to see your creativity here. You can create a barbone backend program which gives a list of outputs or if you choose. You can focus on creating the best algorithms or you can alternatively choose to focus on creating the best way to present your recommendations for savings in the most understandable way.

Your solution will be evaulated on the method you used.

## Quality: 
Your solution will be evaluated on the quality of the code.

## Presentation:
